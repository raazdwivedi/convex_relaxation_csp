In this report, we 
\begin{itemize}
\item Define a ``constraint satisfaction problem" (CSP), and state how CSP's relate to the Unique Games Conjecture.
\item Present a generic LP relaxation for all CSP's, an associated rounding scheme, and the weaknesses of this approach.
\item Demonstrate the generic LP rounding technique on EXAMPLE.
\item Present a generic SDP relaxation (``Basic SDP") for all CSP's.
\item Present two rounding schemes for Basic SDP that (1) apply to \textit{all} CSP's, (2) are polynomial time in theory, and (3) are nevertheless impractical.
\item Demonstrate \textit{the} classic SDP rounding scheme : Goemans-Williamson Rounding, on EXAMPLE.
\item Demonstrate a rounding scheme for Basic SDP that applies to all ``Unique" CSP's.
\item Experiment with a selection of rounding schemes for Basic SDP. The rounding schemes are meant to be generic and have practical run time, but do not come with any theoretical analysis.
\end{itemize}
